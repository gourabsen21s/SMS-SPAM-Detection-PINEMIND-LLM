# 🌲 PineMind LLM: SMS Spam Classifier  

A **powerful and efficient Large Language Model** engineered for precision SMS spam detection.  
PineMind is a fine-tuned solution, meticulously built to be both **performant** and **easily adaptable** to new text classification tasks.  

---

## 🌟 Key Features  

✅ **Custom Transformer Architecture** – Built on a streamlined transformer with MultiHeadAttention, GELU activation, FeedForward layers, and LayerNorm.  
✅ **Highly Efficient Classification** – Fine-tuned on SMS spam detection for superior accuracy.  
✅ **Fine-Tuning Ready** – Easily adaptable for sentiment analysis, topic labeling, or any classification task.  
✅ **PyTorch Implementation** – Clean, modular, and well-commented code for easy modification.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup  

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SMS-SPAM-Detection-PINEMIND-LLM.git
   cd SMS-SPAM-Detection-PINEMIND-LLM
````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(requirements.txt should include: `torch`, `pandas`, `tiktoken`)*

3. **Download Pre-trained GPT-2 Weights**

   * PineMind is fine-tuned on GPT-2 (355M).
   * Download weights manually and place them in:

     ```
     models/355M/
     ```

     *(Files: `hparams.json`, `model.ckpt`, etc.)*

## 🚀 Getting Started

The core workflow is available in **`classifier.ipynb`**, which walks through:

* Data preprocessing
* Model training
* Evaluation
* Prediction on new messages

---

## 📝 Training the Model

* **Base Model**: GPT-2 (355M)
* **Optimizer**: AdamW
* **Learning Rate**: `5e-5`
* **Weight Decay**: `0.1`
* **Dataset**: Publicly available SMS Spam Detection dataset

**Steps:**

1. Ensure your dataset is in `spam.csv` with columns: **Text, Label**
2. Run `classifier.ipynb`
3. The notebook will handle:

   * Train/Validation/Test split
   * Training & saving weights (`review_classifier.pth`)
   * Performance evaluation

---

## 🎯 Making Predictions

Example usage after training:

```python
import torch
import tiktoken
from your_module import GPTModel, classify_review

# Initialize tokenizer & device
tokenizer = tiktoken.get_encoding("gpt2")
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Example text
text_to_classify = "You have been selected to receive a FREE gift! Claim now!"

# Predict
result = classify_review(
    text_to_classify,
    gpt,
    tokenizer,
    device,
    max_length=1024  # adjust to your model
)

print(f"The message is classified as: {result}")
```
